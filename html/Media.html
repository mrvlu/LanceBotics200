                                for the 2020 VEX World Championship! This is my last year of high school, and I plan
                                to make this a fantastic season that I'll never forget.

                                making videos for the entire team. Then, I quickly progressed and became 
                                a builder for 200X. This year I became Captain of 200H hoping to 
                                lead the team to its first ever World Championship. The other extracurriculars 
                                I do are ice hockey, yearbook, and DECA in which I am all passionate towards. 
                                This is my last year in high school making it my last year in LanceBotics. 
                                With that in mind, I’m putting in 200% into this team, making sure we have

                                Heyo! I’m Teddy, a fourth year member of LanceBotics. I’ve contributed as a jack-of-all trades programmer, builder, media member and web developer on teams 200B, 74747J, 200X and this year, 200H. Outside of robotics, I co-lead the Leaside Chronicle newspaper and co-lead Stage Crew. My goal this year is to usurp the current lead programmer and claim the title for my own, or bring 200H to worlds. Whichever comes first. Graduation marks the end of my LanceBotics career, so I want to make sure to go out with a BANG! Worlds, here we come!

                                Hey, I’m Cole Kapitain and this is my second and last year on the LanceBotics squad. My primary job on the team is to take pictures during build sessions and tournaments, as well as edit the occasional showcase video. I am involved in many extracurriculars at Leaside, including clubs such as Yearbook Club and DECA, and sports teams like rugby, basketball, and track. Last year, one of our teams qualified for the 2019 VEX World Championships, which is something I would love to do this year. I can’t wait to document our best season yet.

Last year, I created a logo made specifically for 200X. Aside from robotics, I co-run the trivia club at Leaside called “Reach for the Top”.
