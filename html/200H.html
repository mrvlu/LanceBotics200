                                200H is one of two LanceBotics general club teams. The team consists of many new members from all grades, with the most members in grade 9. Last season, this previously three-member team had placed 41st in the Ontario Provincial Championship, and 50th in Robot Skills in Ontario as well. Unfortunately, they were short of their goal of qualifying for the World Championship. This year, the team hopes to qualify and compete at the 2020 VEX World Championship, along with the many new and passionate members they recruited for this season.

                                My name is Martin Alexiev, and this is my second year in robotics. 
                                Last year, I originally began as media taking video as well as 
                                making videos for the entire team. Then, I quickly progressed and became 
                                a builder for 200X. This year I became Captain of 200H hoping to 
                                lead the team to its first ever World Championship. The other extracurriculars 
                                I do are ice hockey, yearbook, and DECA in which I am all passionate towards. 
                                This is my last year in high school making it my last year in LanceBotics. 
                                With that in mind, I’m putting in 200% into this team, making sure we have 
                                the best possible season!

I’ve contributed as a jack-of-all trades programmer, builder, media member and web developer on teams 200B, 74747J, 200X and this year, 200H. Outside of robotics, I co-lead the Leaside Chronicle newspaper and co-lead Stage Crew. My goal this year is to usurp the current lead programmer and claim the title for my own, or bring 200H to worlds. Whichever comes first. Graduation marks the end of my LanceBotics career, so I want to make sure to go out with a BANG! Worlds, here we come!

My goal this season is to gain a strong foundation in robotics and to become an active member in 200H.  I’d also like to see our team get to the championship if all goes well.

                                Hey they're, my name is Owen and this is my first year on robotics. I’m in grade 11 and so far know how to use 2 coding languages which are python and java. My role in 200H is as a programmer. My goals for this season are to understand as much as possible about the new coding language and try and take us to worlds. I’ve heard great things about robotics and I'm excited to compete, hopefully win and get to share a couple laughs with all of you. C-ya later alligator.

                                Hey everyone! My name is David and this is my first year on the Leaside robotics team.I’m in 200H and I signed up for builder and programmer. My goal this season is to learn more about robotics and to help 200H as much as possible. Outside of robotics, I am a part of the Leaside Health Science Club (HOSA) and the Ski Club. In my free time, I like to bike, ski and travel. So far I met a bunch of new friends and developed multiple skills.

                                Hey, I’m John, a fourth year LanceBotics member. I started out on the grade nine team, 200B, and then joined - what was then - the three-man LanceBotics team 200H as a builder and photographer and have continued ever since. Outside of robotics, I’m the co-head of stage crew and have also been a peer tutor. This year, I intend to help my team get to worlds and I would also like to claim the highly prestigious title of ‘robot driver’ to first-handedly demolish the competition.

                                WASUP fellow robotics people, My name is Emanuel Zambelakis and I joined robotics this year.  My role on the team is a builder but I can do almost anything.  I have not been in any other extracurriculars other than robotics. My goal this season is to help build the robot to the capability of moving past all the competition in provincials and making it to worlds and maybe even win at that but there are no promises cause you have to work hard and have dedication in order to get anywhere near that position.  To conclude, I hope to have a great season of  working towards our goals but also to have a little fun along the way because you can’t have a good team if there ain’t any fun and games.

I like to play hockey, hang with friends, and play videogames as well. I hope that I can help the team in whatever way needed and like every team’s goal, we hope we can make it to worlds. So far it has been a great experience and the older teammates have helped me to learn all about robotics, so I feel like this will be a great year.
